ChromeExtension API - Upload Video
The Upload Video endpoint allows you to upload a complete video blob in the POST request body. 
The API will decode the video blob, save it as a temporary video file, extract audio from the video, and transcribe the audio content.

Endpoint
Upload Video (POST)
Upload a complete video blob.
Method: POST
Endpoint:https://chromeextensionapi.onrender.com/upload/
Request Body: Multipart form data with a single field:
recording: The video blob to upload.
Response: JSON with a success message and transcription of the audio.
Example Request:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -F "recording=@video_blob.mp4"https://chromeextensionapi.onrender.com/upload/
Example Response:

json
Copy code
{
    "message": "Video blob uploaded successfully",
    "transcription": "This is the transcribed audio content."
}
Usage
Make a POST request to the "Upload Video" endpoint with the video blob as form data.

The API will decode the video blob, save it as a temporary video file, and extract audio from the video.

The extracted audio content will be transcribed using the Whisper API (OpenAI).

The API will respond with a success message indicating that the video blob was uploaded successfully and provide the transcription of the audio.

Implementation Notes
The API uses moviepy to extract audio from the video and transcribe it using the Whisper API.
Temporary files are created during the process and cleaned up afterward.
Please note that this API does not implement authentication or authorization. Ensure that you handle security concerns in your application as needed.

Make sure to include the correct video_blob in the request body, and the API will take care of processing and transcribing the video content.

# ChromwExtension Api - Append Video Chunk

The **Append Video Chunk** endpoint allows you to append a video chunk to an existing video. This is useful for progressively building a video by uploading and appending multiple chunks of video data. The API takes care of concatenating these chunks into a final video.

## Endpoint

### Append Video Chunk (POST)

- Append a video chunk to an existing video.
- Method: POST
- Endpoint: `https://chromeextensionapi.onrender.com/append/`
- Request Body: Multipart form data containing two fields:
  - `existing_video`: The existing video to which you want to append the new chunk.
  - `new_video`: The new video chunk to be appended.
- Response: JSON with a success message.

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST -F "existing_video=@existing_video.mp4" -F "new_video=@new_video.mp4" https://chromeextensionapi.onrender.com/append/
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
    "message": "Video appended successfully"
}
```

## Usage

1. Make a POST request to the "Append Video Chunk" endpoint with the existing video and the new video chunk as form data.

2. The API will append the new video chunk to the existing video, and the final concatenated video will be stored.

## Implementation Notes

- The API uses moviepy to concatenate video clips, ensuring proper video format and codec compatibility.
- Temporary files are created during the process and cleaned up afterward.

Please ensure that you follow the correct order when appending video chunks to maintain the sequence of the final video.

**Note:** This API does not implement authentication or authorization. Make sure to handle security concerns in your application accordingly.
